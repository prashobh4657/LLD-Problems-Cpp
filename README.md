# Low Level Design Problems

This repository contains a collection of **Low Level Design (LLD) implementations** for various real-world systems and applications.

All solutions are written **in C++** and implemented **in a single file per problem**, while still maintaining proper **Object-Oriented Design, SOLID principles, and Design Patterns**.  
Although each solution is contained in one `.cpp` file, it includes multiple classes, abstractions, and components just like a real production-level OOP design — only the files are not separated.
